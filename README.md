# Birds in Random Forests
This is the winning project of [ErdÃ¶s Institute](https://erdosinstitute.org)'s Data-science-boot-camp 2019. We classify croudsourced audio recordings of bird songs from [Xeno-Canto.org](https://www.xeno-canto.org).

## Introduction
Xeno-canto ([xeno-canto.org](https://www.xeno-canto.org)) is a bird sound crowdsourcing website that has hundreds of thousands (and counting) of recordings from around the world contributed by researchers, scientists, as well as general public. It contains bird sounds and detailed metadata including geotag, time, audio quality, and species name, etc.

In this project we are exploring a small subset of the database by filtering for only high quality birdsong recordings originated from United States. We extract nearly 23,000 feature vectors from about 8,000 recordings and test various classifiers using labels provided in metadata. Following is a bried summary of classifiers tested, along with their accuracy.

|Classifier|Accuracy (top 10 labels)|Accuracy (top 78 labels)
|----------|------------------------|------------------------|
|Logistic regression|17.7%|4.9%|
|SVC|18.4%|4.7%|
|LDA|49.4%|25.3%|
|K-neighbors|60.9%|42.1%|
|Decision Tree|65.8%|44.8%|
|Random Forest (RF)|79.4%|66.0%|
|RF + Adaboost|80.6%|65.2%|
|Extremely RF|83.5%|70.4%|
